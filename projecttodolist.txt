To-Do List
----------

Short-term:
* Recenter existing test cases to do side by side analysis, small multiples
* Documentation: more of it
* Code refactoring: functionizing, making generic (data variable/value, get rid of center column and hardcode), etc.
* Design a user interface and build it out
* Find a better Lagrange function: All monotonic, all the time (stepwise)
  1-2 hours to build stepwise function
* Figure out Jenks for distance
  ? hours best one-dimensional clustering algorithm in R?

Mid-term:
* Better test cases (different data): Remittances to India, airline routes in the United States (DTW, ORD; add Toronto? Winnipeg?), officials from Xinjiang in Qing Dynasty, trampoline park data from NH/MA, other historian friends 
  Getting NH data next
* Accepting JSON/GeoJSON instead of just CSV input
  Research soon but do later
* Adding centroids to polygons in input data (use the NH case?)
* Accept that the center might also carry value (null or not?)
  Add a question: should the center point have null value or a numeric value?
* TIN/Delauney Triangles
* Control contours at all (move out of GGplot into sp?) Do it all at the end? Smoothing functions with existing approach?
  Eve to look into more seriously

Long-term:
* A sweet paper so we both get a publication out of it. Targets include Cartogaphic Perspectives (unclear word limit), Cartographica, Journal of Maps (2000-4000 words, 10 images), Geoforum (9000 words), EPA (normal article or featured graphic), EPB: Urban Analytics, The Canadian Geographer?
* Add support for doing things with two values/centers at the same time
* Port to JavaScript?
  LAAAAATER once it all works (Shiny app as intermediate? Esquisse?)
