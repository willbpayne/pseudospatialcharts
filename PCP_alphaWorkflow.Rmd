This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

## Input CSV into R
* Read and give headers and datatypes for each (eventually do more sophisticated validation/type detection)

```{r}
routes <- read.csv(file = "testData/routes_bare_sm.csv")

routes <- routes[!(routes$lat>50 | routes$long < -125),]
summary(routes)
# at some point, we need to enforce generic column headers

typeof(routes$isDTW)

     # obnoxiously explicit validation

if (typeof(routes$airport) != "character")
  routes$airport <- as.character(routes$airport)
if (typeof(routes$isDTW) != "logical")
  routes$isDTW <- as.logical(routes$isDTW)
if (typeof(routes$lat) != "double")
  routes$isDTW <- as.double(routes$lat)
if (typeof(routes$long) != "double")
  routes$isDTW <- as.double(routes$long)
if (typeof(routes$flightsDTW) != "integer" && typeof(routes$flightsDTW) != "double" )
  routes$flightsDTW <- as.double(routes$flightsDTW)

typeof(routes$isDTW)

```

## Plot test
```{r}
# coordinate validation
ifelse(max(routes$lat > 90.0) || min(routes$lat < -90.0) || max(routes$long > 180.0) || min(routes$long < -180.0), print("Check your coordinate system..."), print("Coordinates look ok!"))

# test plot
plot(routes$long, routes$lat)
```

## Select origin point from rows
* column "iscenter" value = 1
    + __currently pre-set in test data__
* validate that there is only one center

```{r}
if (sum(routes$isDTW) > 1)
  print("Too many centers. Check data")
if (sum(routes$isDTW) == 0)
  print("No center. Check data. Maybe we'll have an interface to select one later")
if (sum(routes$isDTW) == 1)
  print("There is one center! Hooray!")
```

## Declare a data frame; make it an object we want to use

```{r}
class(routes)
```

## Coordinates
* Go through lat and long
* Calculate distance (pairs) btwn all pairs and origin
     + __important__ right angle indiv coorinate distance, not diagonal pt distance
     + eg, dist btwn X(a) and X(1) in km assuming constant Lat, not dist btwn X(a),Y(a) and X(1),Y(1)
          + also __surely there's a library for this__ : spDistN1? recs from geodessy-dorks? library geosphere?
* Save values as new columns called latDist and lonDist
* Find max dist of any value within latDist OR lonDist
     + WP: this would probably eff up a basemap, but helpful for us in our analytical purpose. 
     + __NB:__ do we need to think more about great circles?
* set bounding box for plot and save for later
     + Take maxVal and double for height and width of bounding box
          + This solves some of our hypotenuse fears bc max coord dist still captured
     + not a proper bounding box, setting an extent, but don't necessarily need to declare lat/long coordos ()

## Scale changes
```{r}
plot2 <- ggplot(routes, aes(routes$long, routes$lat, color = routes$distance)) + geom_point() + geom_point(data = (as.data.frame(ctrPt)), aes(ctrPt[1], ctrPt[2]), color = "orange")

# this doesn't work (produces NaNs or infinites), but sets a basic structure
plot2 + scale_x_log10(limits = c(xlim1,xlim2)) + scale_y_log10(c(ylim1,ylim2))

# really, we need a radial log scale, which would create a different structure than perhaps ggplot2 can offer
```
```{r} 

# we need a way of fitting a distance decay function (or is this an inverse distance decay function technically?) to the actual data, finding what's appropriate for the patterns you're trying to show in any given set.

# experimenting with a few basic ones for the test data, a square root function looks decent. and for people who are stats/quantitative geography junkies they might already know what distance decay suits their data based on previous literature (see the Taylor piece I added to the GitHub repo for some of the space cadet thoughts on this in geography). but what if there was a more custom solution that used math, but didn't really rely on our users knowing any? CATEGORICAL MAPPING (with a great R package name: catmaps), or PSEUDOSPATIAL CHARTS.

# two ideas:

# A. user-defined control points for the decay function. we say that 0 is the origin and 1200 pixels/units is maxdist (or whatever; i chose a number divisible by three for purposes of illustration, ggplot resizes dynamically but you get the point), and since we're trying to show things that are roughly (i) close, (ii) medium, and (iii) far; ask the user: how far away would something need to be from the origin to still be considered "close" in this data set? how far away would it need to get to be considered "far"? if the user says that airports within 500 miles are close, then 500 miles of distance in any direction would give you 400 pixels/units from the origin. if they say that over 2000 miles would be far, then that tells us that 800 pixels/units from the origin is equivalent to 2000 miles of real distance.

# so now we have the following four points and we need to find the smoothest function we can to fit them: (0,0), (500,400), (2000,800), (maxdist,1200). sounds like a regression problem! which R has been known to handle once or twice before. once we have the equation figured out, we just send all our distances through it. again, radial distances and bearings would be ideal since this is another potentially earth-distorting step, but that's okay for now. replot and PROFIT.

# B. data-driven approach using a similar approach to choropleth classes; obviously equal interval is boring, but we could define classes using natural breaks or some other clustering algorithm. does this get us closer to a liquid resize? maybe, but as long as it's labeled, is it still workable?

```
